#!@MCHS_PREFIX@/bin/bash
##
## McHs script for backing up $PREFIX (package installation dir).
## For restore script, see "mchs-restore".
##
## Why it doesn't implement support for backing up $HOME: that's all
## about implementation of mchs-restore script:
##
##  * mchs-restore can't selectively restore files due to tar option
##     --recursive-unlink, that will erase file tree before extracting.
##
##  * mchs-restore has to maintain support of piped input. Therefore
##    we can't allow optional backup of home by mchs-backup. Here is
##    why: with piped input it is not possible to check contents of
##    backup file (you can't seek piped content twice). We must be
##    sure that all directories selected for restore are present
##    inside archive and this is possible only with hardcoded
##    configuration (e.g. backup only $PREFIX). Otherwise, for example,
##    restore procedure may fail or even worse, erase all directories
##    (potentially user data) that are not present in backup.
##
## Considering the mentioned 2 major issues, should be obvious that
## we have literally 2 choices: either backup only $PREFIX or backup
## both $HOME and $PREFIX unconditionally, to ensure consistency of
## data passed to mchs-restore.
##
## However the current choice is to stick to backing up only $PREFIX,
## to leave responsibility of managing files in $HOME to user (as said
## above, mchs-restore script ERASES DATA before restore).
